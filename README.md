# myweb

This is the client side of my application, which provides authorized user to create the request of a dot by entering data in the form or clicking on the plot. After that the requset will be sent to the server and user get a response. 
The application enable to sign in or sign up, get JWT token and store it in the localstorage. JWT token will be taken in the "Authorization" header with each request.
I am using vue-router to make a navigation and some rules that won't allow to unauthorized users get the main page and make requests.
